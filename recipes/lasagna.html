            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd 
                and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. 
                It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
            <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce 
                and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. 
                Here's the run-down:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, 
                    and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. 
                    The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. 
                    We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- 
                    like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna 
                    great flavor!</li>
                <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer 
                    of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until 
                    you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
            </ol>
